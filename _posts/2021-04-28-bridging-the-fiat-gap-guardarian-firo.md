We are excited to announce our partnership with [Guardarian](https://guardarian.com/), a premier white-label payment gateway that bridges the gap between fiat and crypto. This partnership introduces two fiat pairs: Firo/USD and Firo/EUR, that will enable fiat to Firo purchases via credit card and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) EUR transfers.

Guardarian makes purchasing crypto easy and convenient through multiple payment methods, including Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay and bank transfers. Individuals can buy or sell Firo in just 10 minutes with some of the best exchange rates and fees offered on the market.

## What does this mean for Firo users?

Firo users can now purchase and transact a maximum of 2,000 EUR per transaction—up to 20,000 EUR per month—through Guardarian’s platform and mobile app. An account is not required for exchanges, and only a mobile phone number and proof of ID are needed to verify identities. All transactions feature integrated KYC/AML procedures and verifications to meet global regulations. 

This integration enhances Firo’s utility among individuals and businesses and continues our work of introducing new integrations and bridges to our users. 

“This partnership offers Firo an excellent opportunity to collaborate with a service backed by major payment solutions. We hope our work with Guardarian will continue to amplify Firo’s use and adoption among individuals that yearn for easier ways to buy, sell and spend crypto while maintaining transactional privacy on the blockchain. And although we champion privacy, we also recognize the need for compliance within the industry when dealing with fiat to achieve mass adoption. Guardarian’s approach to simplifying KYC/AML procedures reduces friction on this front while remaining compliant to regulators’ recommendations.” Reuben Yap, Project Steward of Firo
