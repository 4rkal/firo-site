The Multidisciplinary Academic Grants in Cryptocurrencies (MAGIC) Grants now supports donations in Firo! 

MAGIC Grants is a public charity that supports various cryptocurrency networks, which they believe are essential public payment infrastructure. MAGIC Grants empowers communities to set up MAGIC Funds for various projects deemed essential. These Funds are semi-autonomous and can choose to fund various qualifying activities, including educational materials, essential developer maintenance, research, and security audits.

As a registered 501(c)(3) public charity, donations through MAGIC are tax deductible for US citizens and in addition to Firo, they also accept other leading cryptocurrencies and fiat donations that you can do via bank/wire transfer or even credit card.

For the Firo project we will be running a purpose specific fundraising campaign for a Lelantus Spark code audit. Details will be shared in a later post. This is not to be confused with the Lelantus Spark cryptography audit that was funded by the community and the core team through the Firo Crowdfunding System and is currently being completed by Hashcloak.

We look forward to expanding Firoâ€™s funding options and are excited to work together with MAGIC Grants.
