This is a **mandatory** release that moves the Lelantus joinsplit payload into the *vExtrapayload* section and allows Trezor support to be re-enabled.

This release also contains fixes for those having unspendable funds stuck in Sigma.

Please update before the **hard fork** scheduled at block **401580** (approximately August 26, 2021).

**Backup your wallet** prior to updating for safety.

We will be launching our testnet for FiroPoW and Elysium very soon. 

Stay tuned for updates.
