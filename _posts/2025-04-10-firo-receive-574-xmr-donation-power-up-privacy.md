We are thrilled to announce that Firo has received an additional donation of **574 XMR**—equivalent to roughly **USD 125,000** at the time of donation—from our long-term supporter, [Power Up Privacy,](https://powerupprivacy.com/) a privacy advocacy group. This new contribution will be used to further our ongoing development, enhance privacy research, and expand our awareness-building efforts.

## A Consistent Supporter of Firo

Power Up Privacy has repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to Firo’s mission of financial privacy and decentralization, providing past donations and liquidity injections that have helped us remain robust, flexible, and forward-looking. In August 2024, they donated directly to support Firo’s development, and shortly thereafter, they played a key role in expanding our liquidity. By continuing to support us, Power Up Privacy strengthens our ability to deliver cutting-edge privacy technology to crypto enthusiasts worldwide.

This latest donation will:

1) **Accelerate Development**: Support ongoing research and development of Firo's privacy protocols and upcoming features.

2) **Extend Awareness**: Fund strategic marketing and education initiatives, introducing more people to the importance of financial privacy and the unique qualities Firo offers.

3) **Reinforce Liquidity**: Sustain healthy trading environments across exchanges, benefiting both new and existing community members.
