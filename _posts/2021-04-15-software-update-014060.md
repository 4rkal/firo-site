We are happy to release Firo v0.14.6.0 which patches a Lelantus vulnerability and also includes extensive hardening measures. Details on these changes can be found in this [Github PR.](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1012)

A hard fork is scheduled at block **365544** (approximately April 22, 2021, 2:00 PM UTC). Please update your wallets and nodes as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions. Once enough of the network has upgraded and stabilized past the hard fork, we will reactivate Lelantus transactions.

We also have a [new Electrum light wallet](https://github.com/firoorg/electrum-firo/releases/tag/4.0.9.2) with Firo branding released. Our revamped rich GUI wallet is also expected to be released soon.
