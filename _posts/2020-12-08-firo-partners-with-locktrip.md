Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) has partnered with LockTrip (https://locktrip.com/), a blockchain-based travel website which offers up to 60% discounts on more than 2 Million Hotels & Vacation Rentals thanks to its unique reverse-auctioning model. They achieve this by removing the hefty commissions imposed by intermediaries. As a result, the least discounted prices are still equal to booking.com!

Starting on the 16th December, LockTrip will be listing Firo as a direct payment option, which in addition to the hotels and properties, will allow Firo users to book from over 1000 airlines.

The following screenshot illustrates the price savings when booking through LockTrip.com vs Booking.com. Both screenshots are for the same accommodation at the same time, but there is over 32% saving when booking through LockTrip.

LockTrip values honesty and doesn’t pressure-sell with warnings like "only 1 room left" or present members "special deals" that are not special, and uses fully transparent booking smart contracts. Each booking also burns 3% of the booking value in LOC.

Reuben Yap, Co-Founder & Project Steward of Firo was quoted saying:
“We’re thrilled about this partnership as it adds another excellent option to allow people to spend Firo for accommodation and travel almost everywhere worldwide especially as travel restrictions ease up.”

Nikola Alexandrov, CEO of LockTrip says:
“We are excited to welcome Firo to our growing family and strengthening our mission of making hefty travel commissions a thing of the past.”

To celebrate the Firo integration, Locktrip is running a promotion where you can use the code “VB7RV” when signing up to unlock an additional 6% savings! The code needs to be entered during the signup. It is not possible to enter it afterwards. The code will be valid for the first 100 sign-ups.

LockTrip also have an affiliate program that allows people to earn additional income (https://academy.locktrip.com/)
