He earned a masters degree in Information Security from Johns Hopkins University where he wrote a paper on a proposed practical implementation of the Zerocoin protocol. He has been instrumental in laying the foundations of Zcoin's (now Firo) technology from implementing the world's first implementation of Zerocoin and also pushing for the research and development into the MTP mining algorithm. Poramin has been focused on pushing for the adoption of Firo into the real world especially in his involvement in facilitating the Thai Democrat Party to conduct its primary elections to elect its party leader on Firo's blockchain and also integrating Firo into the Thai economy via his regulated cryptocurrency exchange Satang Pro. Lately, his work has been focused on Exodus, Firo's tokenization layer that allows anyone to build their own private tokens on Firo's blockchain.</p>
