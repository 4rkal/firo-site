A huge thank you  to everyone who voted and shared their thoughts and feedback.</p>

<p>Through several rounds of polls, the community has decided on the implementation of three things to Firo’s tokenomics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A fixed emission of 6.25 FIRO/block until the cap of 21.4 million FIRO is hit</li>
  <li>A tail emission of 1 FIRO/block thereafter</li>
  <li>A block reward division of 70% Masternodes, 5% Miners, 15% Dev, 10% Community (previously 50% Masternodes, 25% miners, 15% Dev, 10% community)</li>
</ul>

<p>View the <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-final-tokenomics-and-block-division/3379">final poll results</a></p>

<p>For a more accurate reflection of community sentiment, we employed a system known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">ranked-choice voting or instant run-off</a>. This system allowed voters to select multiple choices and then rank them in order of preference, ensuring that the final decision better represents the community’s preferences.</p>

<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>

<p>To read through how the Firo community arrived at this decision, you can follow the timeline and links to the relevant discussions below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>April 2024: Initial discussion about tokenomics. <a href="https://firo.org/2024/04/23/firo-tokenomics-and-halving.html">blog</a> <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/firo-tokenomics-discussion-with-upcoming-halving/3162">forum</a></li>
  <li>June-July 2024: Polls were held regarding [tail emission](https://forum.firo.org/t/firo-tokenomics-discussion-with-upcoming-halving/3162], the [development and community fund], and <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-should-firo-keep-its-halving-schedule-or-should-we-revisit-our-emission-curve/3276">the rate of emission</a></li>
  <li>July 2024: A <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/discussion-on-final-poll-options-for-tokenomics-and-block-division/3345">thread</a> was opened to ensure that the final poll’s voting options would cover all options that the community cared about.</li>
  <li>August 2024: <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-final-tokenomics-and-block-division/3379">Final polls</a> to vote on the proposed changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="effect-of-changes">Effect of Changes</h2>

<p>The primary effect of the changes is to provide improved incentives for masternodes for the next 4 years, recognizing their continued role and unwavering support of the network. Miners will still contribute to the hybrid PoW/masternode consensus mechanism, but while the hashrate adjusts, there may be a period of slow blocks until the difficulty adjusts to the new hashrate. The chain will remain protected against 51% attacks with Firo’s <a href="https://firo.org/2021/01/28/chainlocks-activated-mainnet.html">masternode chainlocks</a>. Assuming current masternode numbers are maintained at around 3900+ master nodes, the current returns of a masternode will increase from around 16.5% p.a. to around 22% p.a.</p>

<p>There is also a significant change to the supply schedule of Firo to reflect the existence of developed infrastructure and markets for the distribution of cryptocurrencies compared to the time when Bitcoin was first created. Prior to the change, Firo followed Bitcoin’s emission schedule and the block reward would have halved roughly every 4 years with it finally ceasing after it hit 21.4 million. Firo has had a single halving prior to this and was set to have its 2nd halving in mid September 2024. With the new change coming into effect, there will be no more halvings and the existing emission of 6.25 FIRO/block is maintained until the supply of 21.4 million has been fully issued over the next 5-6 years.</p>

<p>After the 21.4 million limit is hit, to ensure a stable monetary supply and a continued stable security subsidy, a fixed tail emission of 1 FIRO/block will continue in perpetuity which works out to be 0.98% inflation rate p.a. at the beginning and over time trends to 0%. To read more about the effects of tail emission and how it leads to a stable monetary supply that is neither inflationary nor deflationary, you can read this <a href="https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary">article</a>. There’s also strong <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf">academic evidence</a> that indicates that having no block reward results in instability in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>To view the effect of changes in tokenomics to Firo’s supply over time, we’ve plotted this graph starting from the hard fork date of block 958655 (approximately 16 September 2024) over the next 20 years. The times are estimated due to the slight variance in block times. Tail emission is hit roughly halfway into year 14 (5+ years from hard fork date).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/finalized-tokenomics-2024/emissioncomparison2024.png" alt="Chart of emission, old versus new starting 2024" /></p>

<h2 id="future-direction">Future Direction</h2>

<p>The core team is making a firm commitment not to propose further changes to Firo’s tokenomics until tail emission is hit. This commitment is aimed at providing stability and certainty to the Firo community, ensuring a secure and confident future.</p>

<p>We will be deploying these changes in release <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/tag/v0.14.14.0">Firo v.14.14.0</a>, as these changes are scheduled to come into force by block 958655 (approximately 16 September 2024). Please ensure you are updated to the <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/latest">latest version</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, the core team will also be rolling out an updated roadmap for Firo, laying out development and adoption goals for the next few years. This will also include research into blockchain consensus models that would be secure and sustainable through tail emission and also a renewed focus on increasing awareness and adoption.</p>

<p>Again, we would like to thank the community members who have stood by the project and taking part in governance to guide Firo’s future.</p>]]></content><author><name>Reuben Yap</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through Firo’s governance process, Firo’s emission and block reward division has been finalized!

<p>After seeking community feedback and <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-final-tokenomics-and-block-division/3379">preliminary polls</a> since June, we are now approaching the penultimate poll to definitively decide Firo’s future.</p>

<p>The two primary issues being voted on are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What should Firo’s block reward division be?</li>
  <li>What should Firo’s emissions be?</li>
</ul>

<p>These polls touch on important issues, such as whether there should be a development and/or community fund, the sustainability of masternodes and the role of miners. It also looks into the long-term sustainability of Firo as to whether it should adopt a tail emission or stick closer to the original Bitcoin model.</p>

<p>Instead of a single-choice vote, the poll allows community members to rank their options, resulting in a fairer reflection of sentiment. This is also known as <a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/">ranked-choice voting</a> and is suitable where there are many options to choose from.</p>

<p>Campfire is a Firo-only wallet with a default on Spark privacy. It features many other Firo-specific enhancements, such as masternode collateral recognition and EX-address support. It also includes inbuilt TOR for additional network privacy. It even works on both desktop and mobile devices!</p>

<p>Like its namesake, Campfire is designed to be a warm, welcoming experience where our Firofam can begin their privacy journey.</p>

<h2 id="improved-user-experience">Improved User Experience</h2>

<p>Much work has been put into making the wallet user-friendly with Firo colours, and our Sparky mascot is featured prominently.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/campfirewallet/preview-1.png" alt="Mobile Preview 1" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/campfirewallet/preview-2.jpg" alt="Desktop Preview 2" /></p>

<p>Under the hood, both teams have made many optimisations to make Spark transactions and syncing speedy and snappy, even with the complex math behind them.</p>

<p>Instead of using the default server, users can choose to host their own light server backend for even more privacy.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>

<p>Campfire remains true to our goals of being free and open source. All source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/campfire">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>While the original Campfire started as a Firo wallet that supported our previous privacy protocol, Lelantus, the new revamped Campfire has full Spark privacy support and shares the same internals as Stack wallet, a multi-coin wallet also developed by Cypher Stack.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>We would like to develop more features for Campfire, such as DEX support and Spark asset support!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cross-margin">What is Cross Margin?</h2>

<p>In Cross Margin, the entire margin balance is shared across open positions to avoid liquidation. If Cross Margin is enabled, the trader risks losing their entire margin balance, along with any open positions, in the event of a liquidation. Any realized PnL (profit and loss) from another position can support a losing position that is close to being liquidated.</p>

<p>With the existing Isolated Margin mode, you can allocate a specific amount of margin to a single position to limit risks. In contrast, the Cross Margin mode uses the balance of your entire Margin Account on Binance as collateral, providing you with greater flexibility and lower margin requirements.

<p>EX addresses are not meant for regular users to create but for exchanges that require them for regulatory or transparency reasons. However, users will need to interact with EX addresses if they are depositing into Binance or another exchange that deploys them.</p>

<p>You can identify an EX-address easily as the address begins with EXX.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/exaddressbinance/exaddress.png" alt="Binance deposit EX address" /></p>

<h2 id="transition-notes">Transition Notes</h2>

<p>Binance has confirmed the roll out of EX-addresses for its users, though if for some reason you do not have an EX-address yet, do not send funds from Spark directly to Binance’s deposit address. Otherwise, they will be frozen until you open a support ticket with Binance to return the funds to you. This process can take up to 30 working days.</p>

<p>EX-addresses only accept FIRO from transparent addresses. If you have funds held in Spark, you would first need to send them to a transparent address (that begins with a or Z) before sending them to the EX address. At the time of writing, the only exchange that uses EX addresses is Binance.</p>

<p>Most exchanges do not yet support withdrawals to an EX-address, so you would need to withdraw from your own wallet first with a transparent address before sending the money to Binance. We are in communication with other centralised exchanges to facilitate easy exchange-to-exchange transfers. At the time of writing, only NonKYC.io supports direct withdrawals to an EX address. You can also do your part by opening a ticket with your favourite exchange or wallet to encourage them to support sending to EX-addresses.</p>

<p>Most major exchanges such as MEXC, HTX and Gate support FIRO deposits from EX-addresses so you can send from Binance to these exchanges directly. Always test with a small amount first if unsure!</p>

<h2 id="rpcs-for-better-spark-light-wallet-support">RPCs for better Spark light wallet support</h2>

<p>New RPCs allow for light wallet servers to query the node for Spark state allowing for mobile wallets to recognize Spark transactions in the mempool even before they’re included in a block. It also ensures proper balance calculation in certain edge cases.</p>

<p>We have also added a way for mobile wallets to recognize masternode collateral so that it will ignore it when sending FIRO.</p>

<p>This is in preparation of our new Firo-only mobile wallet release and also a light desktop wallet developed together with Cypher Stack.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1457">increased the maximum transaction relay size from 100 kB to 250 kB</a> allowing for easier consolidation of UTXOs and Spark minting. Nodes that do not upgrade will not be able to relay these larger transactions.</p>

<p>We have also included various other bug fixes in relation to Lelantus migration to Spark and user interface improvements.</p>

<p>While there is no deadline for upgrading, we recommend you to update as soon as possible. Mining pools and masternodes are encouraged to update immediately to ensure the network will propagate these larger transactions.</p>

<h2 id="spark-optimization-improvements">Spark Optimization Improvements</h2>

<p>We have various improvements to <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1431">Spark batch verification</a> and <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1417">Spark transaction processing</a> improving sync times.</p>
