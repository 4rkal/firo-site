<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firo/">CoinMarketCap</a> and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/firo">CoinGecko</a> have updated their circulating and total supply figures. Original post below remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Dear Firo Community,</p>

<p>We would like to inform you about an important update regarding Firo’s reported circulating supply and market capitalization as listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap (CMC). Please rest assured that there has been <strong>no new vulnerability</strong> discovered, nor any actual increase in Firo’s real supply. Instead, the discrepancy stems from outdated API endpoints and a miscalculation in supply reporting.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>On February 21, 2025, at block height 1049420 (06:42 UTC), both CoinGecko and CMC were found to be using an old API endpoint on the Insight explorer.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://explorer.zcoin.io/api/zerocoin/getrealsupply</code></p>

<p>This endpoint dates back to when Firo was known as Zcoin. As a result of this outdated API, Firo’s supply was incorrectly reported as <strong>14,701,999</strong>, significantly lower than its actual figure.</p>

<h2 id="reasons-for-the-discrepancy">Reasons for the Discrepancy</h2>

<h3 id="incorrect-zerocoin-inflation-calculation">Incorrect Zerocoin Inflation Calculation</h3>

<p>The old API on the Insight explorer used the following formula to calculate Zerocoin-related supply:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Coinbase - Zerocoin mints + Zerocoin spends</code></p>

<p>However, in the code, <strong>Zerocoin spends</strong> was treated as a negative number which caused the spend amount to be subtracted from the total instead of it being added back in, leading to an underestimation of Firo’s supply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The erroneous calculation was introduced <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/insight-api-firo/commit/bd535426e082b2ecbb1ec0d9849c37e0884b2866">here</a> in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, the bug can be traced to <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/insight-api-firo/commit/bd535426e082b2ecbb1ec0d9849c37e0884b2866#diff-2dc1e3cd3d8546425b65b839444b59413f1ee621908bac40ddcd4b263047e1ccR63">this part of the code.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This issue only exists on the Insight Explorer code and not the core Firo software.</p>

<h3 id="unaccounted-inflation-from-bitcoin-cve-2018-17144">Unaccounted Inflation from Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144</h3>

<p>Additionally, the old API did not factor in <strong>152,740.3176572</strong> coins created due to the <a href="https://firo.org/2020/08/20/disclosure-of-bug-in-zcoin.html">Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144 vulnerability</a> in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="correct-supply-figure">Correct Supply Figure</h2>

<p>The correct supply figure, as of block 1049420, is approximately <strong>16,964,245.</strong> The following pull request consolidates the calculation of disclosed Zerocoin attacks and the inflation amounts from Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144 into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gettotalsupply</code> command:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1502">PR #1502: Correct total supply calculation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As explained further below, this does not factor coins in Lelantus and Sigma pools. While no new Lelantus or Sigma coins can be created, withdrawals from the respective pools are still allowed.</p>

<h2 id="updated-inflation-calculation-for-bitcoin-cve-2018-17144">Updated Inflation Calculation for Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144</h2>

<p>After a detailed review, we also discovered that the original estimate of coins created from the Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144 vulnerability was overstated. Here is the corrected breakdown:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Total created from CVE-2018-17144:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>320,841.99803185 Firo</li>
</ul>

<p>(Previously reported as ~384,400.82268276)</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li><strong>Recovered and <a href="https://explorer.firo.org/tx/0b53178c1b22bae4c04ef943ee6d6d30f2483327fe9beb54952951592e8ce368">burnt:</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>168,101.68037465 Firo</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Net Inflation from CVE-2018-17144:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>152,740.3176572 Firo</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the underreporting of Firo’s supply on CMC and CoinGecko is around <strong>2,262,246</strong> coins, leading to a lower-than-actual market cap figure on both platforms.</p>

<h2 id="lelantus-and-sigma-considerations">Lelantus and Sigma Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="lelantus-vulnerability"><strong>Lelantus Vulnerability:</strong></h3>

<p>We estimate around <strong>59,000</strong> coins may have been created via the Lelantus vulnerability. However, these figures will only be <strong>conclusively confirmed once the Lelantus pools are closed,</strong> which is expected around <strong>January 2026.</strong></p>

<h3 id="sigma-pool-closure"><strong>Sigma Pool Closure:</strong></h3>

<p>We anticipate <strong>16,072</strong> coins to be permanently removed from circulation when the Sigma pool is closed in an upcoming hard fork. This closure will be rolled out together with the Spark Names feature.</p>

<p>The quantum of these coins will not drastically affect supply and once these pools are closed (meaning no more withdrawals from the Lelantus and Sigma pools would be allowed), the exact supply can be verified and updated. This balances the need to retire older privacy protocols which are no longer maintained to reduce any attack surface while giving users several years to withdraw their coins.</p>

<p>Sigma was replaced by Lelantus on 14 January 2021 and Lelantus was replaced by Lelantus Spark on 18 January 2024. This means that Sigma users have been given 4 years to withdraw their Sigma coins and Lelantus users will be given approximately 2 years as <a href="https://forum.firo.org/t/emergency-switch-functionality-for-lelantus-lelantus-spark-to-extend-or-retire/2749/37">decided by community feedback.</a></p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Updating API Endpoints</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixing gettotalsupply</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ongoing Monitoring</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="updating-api-endpoints">Updating API Endpoints</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://explorer.firo.org/api/ext/getmoneysupply">new and correct API endpoints</a> will be used by both CoinGecko and CMC, ensuring accurate reporting of Firo’s total circulating supply. This may take a while for them to verify and update their endpoints.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-gettotalsupply">Fixing gettotalsupply</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1502">gettotalsupply RPC command</a> has been updated to accurately include all known inflation from both the Zerocoin attacks and the Bitcoin CVE-2018-17144 exploit. This fix will be included in the <strong>next release.</strong></p>

<h3 id="ongoing-monitoring">Ongoing Monitoring</h3>

<p>We will continue to monitor and verify Firo’s total supply as we move closer to closing the Lelantus and Sigma pools. We remain committed to transparency and accuracy in all reporting.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No New Vulnerabilities</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Corrected Figures</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Updated Market Cap</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Future Updates</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-new-vulnerabilities"><strong>No New Vulnerabilities:</strong></h3>

<p>There is no new exploit or change in the <strong>actual</strong> supply of Firo, merely an underreporting primarily due to old explorer APIs.</p>

<h3 id="corrected-figures"><strong>Corrected Figures:</strong></h3>

<p>The corrected circulating supply is around <strong>16,964,245</strong> Firo.</p>

<h3 id="updated-market-cap"><strong>Updated Market Cap:</strong></h3>

Mining remains an essential pillar—especially for those who prefer to acquire Firo without relying on an exchange. Recent developments, however, have prompted discussions about the VRAM requirements for mining Firo. We’d like the community’s input on how to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="background-firopows-increasing-dag-size">Background: FiroPOW’s Increasing DAG Size</h2>

<p>When FiroPOW was introduced in 2021, it began with a VRAM requirement of <strong>4 GB.</strong> From the outset, our mining algorithm was designed to steadily increase its DAG size. The purpose?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Discourage the use of older, dirt-cheap GPUs</strong> that large farms could easily accumulate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maintain a level of decentralization</strong> by using relatively modern GPUs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Since FiroPOW’s launch, the DAG size has continued to grow at approximately <strong>8 MB every 1,300 blocks</strong> (about <strong>2.26 days</strong>). Recently, it <strong>surpassed 7.7 GB</strong>, causing many 8 GB GPUs to fall below the mining threshold due to the GPU overhead.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-to-revisit-this">Why We Need to Revisit This</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evolving GPU Market:</strong> Mid-range GPUs from 2015 typically had 2-4 GB of VRAM, increasing to 4–8 GB in the 2016–2019 period. Even in 2020–2023, many mid-range cards still ship with 6–8 GB. Meanwhile, rumors suggest the upcoming RTX 5060 may only have 8 GB of VRAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Continued Role of Miners:</strong> Although Firo has a hybrid consensus system, miners still play an important part in securing the network and offering an alternative onramp to Firo ownership. If VRAM requirements climb too high, we risk excluding a broader audience of potential miners—particularly those using mid-range GPUs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="balancing-accessibility-and-security">Balancing Accessibility and Security</h2>

<p>On one hand, <strong>increasing the DAG size</strong> reduces the risk of someone acquiring large amounts of outdated GPUs at bargain prices to exploit or attack the network. On the other hand, setting the VRAM requirement too high leaves many loyal miners—and potential new ones—unable to participate.</p>

<p><strong>Current Options Being Discussed</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maintain the requirement at around 8GB:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This aligns with most mid-range cards from the past few years.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensures even upcoming rumored 8GB GPUs can participate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If VRAM trends change significantly, we can revisit in the future.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lower to just under 6GB and allow it to creep up slowly:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This potentially opens up Firo mining to more people immediately.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Still gradually phases out older cards but at a slower rate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Balances concerns about security with broader accessibility.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Possibly reduces the need for a future hard-fork when VRAM in GPUs increase</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep status-quo</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Only higher-end cards can mine FIRO</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Potential reduction in security as less GPUs can participate</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>More rewards for remaining miners who can still mine.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p>Spark Names not only tie Spark addresses to a name but can also serve as your decentralized digital identity! While many other address alias protocols primarily focus only on tying handles to crypto addresses, Spark Names allows you to optionally add metadata to your Spark Name, be it social media handles, avatar urls, and any other text based data so that your Spark Name can identify you while keeping your transaction history private. Metadata can be updated through a renewal which you can perform at any time.</p>

<h3 id="ii-spark-names-does-not-compromise-on-privacy">ii) Spark Names does not compromise on privacy:</h3>
<p>In many alias systems like ENS, the alias is tied to a crypto address that can be looked up on the blockchain. This is a huge privacy risk as now everyone not only knows that the address belongs to you, but can see all transaction activity associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/spark-names/image1.png" alt="Image1" /></p>

<p>Spark Names are tied to privacy preserving Spark Addresses (a type of stealth address) which are not searchable on the blockchain, so someone with your Spark Name can only resolve to a Spark Address which does not reveal any transaction details associated with it. This means you can freely share your Spark Name out without someone getting information about the transactions you receive or send much like an e-mail address!</p>

<h3 id="iii-spark-name-fees-fund-community-fund">iii) Spark Name fees fund Community Fund</h3>

<p>As the Firo project doesn’t rely on funding from VCs or investors, it primarily relies on donations and a percentage of the block reward. As Firo gradually moves into decentralized funding, additional continuing sources of revenue are important. All Spark Name related fees are channeled towards the Community Fund led by the community elected <a href="/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-470/id/2022/07/04/community-fund-committee-elected.html">Community Fund Committee</a> which is independent from the Core team. These funds can be used to fund various tasks such as audits, community initiatives, listings or even development tasks to support Firo and its ecosystem.</p>

<p>In future updates should the community desire, Spark Name fees can be burnt or channeled towards miners or masternode holders that can be helpful when Firo goes into tail emission in a couple of years.</p>

<h3 id="iv-spark-names-requires-renewal">iv) Spark Names requires renewal</h3>

<p>Some naming schemes allow perpetual registration which can result in squatting where one user just hogs a lot of potential names. While requiring renewal does not completely prevent this, it ensures that there’s an ongoing price to squat or at least pay a bigger fee upfront to secure a multi-year registration. This also partially addresses issues where users become inactive and yet hold on to valuable aliases. Having Spark Names fee model in this way generates organic demand for FIRO and an ongoing revenue source for the FIRO ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="v--fee-structure-based-on-length">v)  Fee structure based on length</h3>

<p>Spark Name’s fee structure is based on the length of the Spark Name where shorter names have higher fees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One character: 1000 FIRO/year</li>
  <li>Two characters: 100 FIRO/year</li>
  <li>3-5 characters: 10 FIRO/year</li>
  <li>6 characters and above: 1 FIRO/year</li>
</ul>

<p>This properly recognizes the scarcity of shorter names while keeping it affordable to most users instead of a flat rate. Users are free to pre-purchase as many years as they want in advance.</p>

<h3 id="vi-ownership-proof">vi) Ownership proof</h3>

<p>To prevent abuse, users can only register aliases to Spark addresses that they control and not third parties since registration requires an ownership proof. This prevents someone from assigning derogatory or offensive names to your Spark address. In the same logic, we also only allow one Spark Name per Spark address to minimize the chance of confusion.</p>

<h3 id="vii-transfer-of-ownership">vii) Transfer of ownership</h3>

<p>Spark Names allows for the transfer of ownership to a new user should a user decide to sell it. This feature would be unavailable at launch but will be added on at a later time.</p>

<h3 id="when">When?</h3>

<p>We are in the final stages of coding Spark Names and have released it on our internal devnet. We expect to release Spark Names on testnet in a week or two and mainnet in a month after that. We would be requiring a hard fork along with other updates when we roll out Spark Names.</p>

<p>Spark name functionality is also being added into our mobile wallets.</p>

<p>The core team is excited to bring a new level of usability and added functionality to FIRO with Spark Names!</p>]]></content><author><name>Reuben Yap</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a new feature coming to Firo which greatly improves two of the biggest pain points of dealing with crypto: hard to remember cryptocurrency addresses and digital identity!
